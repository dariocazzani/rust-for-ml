# A Comprehensive Guide to Learning Rust for ML Engineers with Python Background

This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to Rust for machine learning engineers with a background in Python programming. It follows the Rust book and covers key topics such as ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and error handling, while also incorporating practical examples and exercises that leverage machine learning concepts using PyTorch. The guide also demonstrates how to build Rust libraries for use with C and C++ and includes exercises and examples that use a GUI. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) will be included as part of the practical examples.
